			<h1 class="style4">Overview</h1>
			<p>
				Weblab is a remote microelectronics laboratory. It allows users to measure the 
				current-voltage characteristics of transistors and other devices at any time, 
				from any physical location, using a Java-enabled web browser.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a name="behind">1.1 Behind the Scenes</a></h2>
			<p>
				At the heart of the Weblab system is the Agilent 4155B Semiconductor Parameter 
				Analyzer, a state-of-theart instrument for measuring the current-voltage 
				characteristics of microelectronics devices with up to eight terminals. The 
				analyzer is connected to an Agilent E5250A Switching Matrix, a multiplexer 
				which allows eight different microelectronics devices to be connected to the 
				system at any given time. Both the analyzer and the switching matrix are 
				controlled through a GPIB interface card on the Weblab server computer. The 
				devices under test are mounted in a packaged form onto standard test fixtures 
				that are connected to the switching matrix.
			</p>
			<p>The user interface forWeblab is a Java applet which duplicates the essential 
				functionality of the analyzer console, allowing the user to set up a 
				measurement for one of the devices that is currently connected to the system 
				(the necessary information about these devices is provided by the server when 
				the applet loads). When the user is ready to execute a measurement, the applet 
				sends the measurement specifications to the server. The server then sets the 
				switching matrix to the appropriate device, instructs the analyzer to run the 
				measurement, obtains the results from the analyzer, and finally transmits the 
				data back to the applet, where they can be graphed and otherwise analyzed by 
				the user.</p>
			<h2><br>
				<a name="measure">1.2 Measurement Units</a></h2>
			<p>
				The analyzer has a total of eight measurement units (four SMUs, two VSUs, and 
				two VMUs) that can be connected to the terminals of a device. Note that these 
				connections are made using physical wires in the lab; it is impossible to 
				change them remotely. Each type of measurement unit has different capabilities.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A Source/Monitor Unit (SMU) is a highly versatile measurement unit which can 
					operate in three different modes:<br>
					V : the SMU functions as a voltage source and a current monitor. It also 
					enforces a compliance value for current (a maximum value that the current is 
					allowed to attain, useful for protecting fragile devices); if the actual 
					current ever reaches the compliance value, then the SMU becomes a constant 
					voltage source for the remainder of the measurement.<br>
					I : the SMU functions as a current source and a voltage monitor. It also 
					enforces a compliance value for voltage; if the actual voltage ever reaches the 
					compliance value, then the SMU becomes a constant current source for the 
					remainder of the measurement.<br>
					COMM : the SMU functions as a common terminal (ground). COMM mode is 
					essentially the same as V mode with the voltage set to zero.<br>
				</li>
				<li>
					A Voltage Source Unit (VSU) functions as a voltage source only. It allows the 
					voltage to be specified more precisely than an SMU in V mode, but it cannot 
					simultaneously function as a current monitor. The compliance value for a VSU is 
					automatically set to approximately 100 mA and cannot be changed.<br>
				</li>
				<li>
					A Voltage Monitor Unit (VMU) functions as a voltage monitor only. It measures 
					voltage more precisely than an SMU in I mode, but it cannot simultaneously 
					function as a current source.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2><br>
				<a name="functions">1.3 Functions</a></h2>
			<p><br>
				Each source unit (this includes VSUs, SMUs in V mode, and SMUs in I mode) has a 
				function that defines the behavior of its output. There are four different 
				functions:<br>
				<strong>CONS :</strong> a constant source, defined by a single value (either a 
				voltage value or a current value, depending on the source type). The source 
				unit maintains this value throughout the measurement.<br>
				<strong>VAR1 :</strong> the primary sweep source. Behavior depends on the scale 
				selected: Linear : defined by a start value, a stop value, and a step value. 
				VAR1 is set to the start value and then repeatedly incremented by the step 
				value until it reaches (or exceeds) the stop value. Generates<img src="images/expr1.jpg" width="141" height="45">data 
				points, evenly spaced in a linear fashion.<br>
				Log10 : defined by a start value and a stop value (no step value). Generates 10 
				data points per decade, evenly spaced in a logarithmic fashion.<br>
				Log25 : defined by a start value and a stop value (no step value). Generates 25 
				data points per decade, evenly spaced in a logarithmic fashion.<br>
				Log50 : defined by a start value and a stop value (no step value). Generates 50 
				data points per decade, evenly spaced in a logarithmic fashion. Only one source 
				unit per measurement may be set to VAR1.<br>
				<strong>VAR2 </strong>: the secondary sweep source, defined just like VAR1 
				except that the scale of VAR2 is always Linear. However, the value of VAR2 is 
				incremented only after every complete sweep of VAR1. Only one source unit per 
				measurement may be set to VAR2.<br>
				<strong>VAR1P :</strong> the synchronous sweep source, defined by a ratio and 
				an o set. The value of VAR1P for each data point is calculated from the value 
				of VAR1 using the following equation:<br>
				VAR1P = VAR1 * ratio + o set<br>
				Only one source unit per measurement may be set to VAR1P.</p>
			<h2><br>
				<a name="sweep">1.4 Sweep Measurements</a></h2>
			<p><br>
				The analyzer uses sweep source functions to perform di erent kinds of sweep 
				measurements. The following sweep measurements are supported by Weblab.<br>
				&bull; A basic sweep measurement uses only one sweep source (VAR1).</p>
			<img src="images/table_sweep.jpg" width="599" height="460"><br>
			Table 1.1: Sweep Measurements
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>A subordinate sweep measurement</strong> uses a primary sweep source 
					(VAR1) and a secondary sweep source (VAR2). The primary sweep loop is nested 
					inside the secondary sweep loop; thus VAR2 will be swept only one time, but 
					VAR1 will be swept many times (once for each value of VAR2). The total number 
					of data points generated by a subordinate sweep measurement is the product of 
					the number of points in each VAR1 sweep and the number of points in each VAR2 
					sweep.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>A synchronous sweep measurement</strong> uses a primary sweep source 
					(VAR1) and a synchronous sweep<br>
					source (VAR1P). Because VAR1P sweeps along with VAR1, the number of data points 
					generated by a synchronous sweep measurement is the same as for the 
					corresponding basic sweep measurement.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is possible to set up a VAR1 source, a VAR2 source, and a VAR1P source all in 
				the same measurement; this has the e ect of performing a synchronous sweep and 
				a subordinate sweep at the same time. Table 1.1 illustrates an example of a 
				measurement that uses all three sweep sources.</p>
			<h2><br>
				<a name="data">1.5 Data Variables</a></h2>
			<p><br>
				Weblab stores data in data variables. A data variable is an array of numerical 
				values containing one element for each data point that was measured by the 
				analyzer. Each data variable is identified by a name (alphanumeric, 6 
				characters maximum). When a measurement is executed, the analyzer generates 
				data for all of the variables that have been de- fined. However, to save 
				bandwidth and time (especially on slower network connections), only those 
				variables that have been selected by the user for download will be included in 
				the results that are transferred from the lab server back to the client (for 
				graphing and further analysis).</p>
			<h2><br>
				<a name="user-defined">1.6 User-Defined Functions</a></h2>
			<p>
				Another helpful feature of the analyzer allows the user to create new data 
				variables which represent real-time functions of the data collected during a 
				measurement (the square root of another data variable, for example). A 
				user-defined function has three components:<br>
				<strong>Name</strong> : the name of the new variable to be created<br>
				<strong>Units </strong>: the units for the results of the function<br>
				<strong>Body</strong> : the body of the function. This is an algebraic 
				expression which may include other variables, builtin analyzer functions, and 
				scientific constants (see section 3.1.2 for details on the syntax of 
				user-defined functions). Once defined, a user-defined function can be treated 
				like any other data variable, and even referred to within the body of another 
				user-defined function. However, recursive definitions (A depends on A) and 
				mutually recursive definitions (A depends on B, and B depends on A) are not 
				allowed.</p>

			<p>
				After a measurement is executed on the analyzer, the results are returned to 
				the client and graphed on the graph canvas in the Results Panel, which is 
				located in the bottom half of the main window. Three axes can be specified for 
				the graph canvas, each representing one of the downloaded data variables: the <strong>
					X Axis</strong>, the <strong>Y1 Axis</strong> (the primary y axis, located 
				on the left), and the <strong>Y2 Axis</strong> (the secondary y axis, located 
				on the right). This allows two 2-dimensional variable relationships to be 
				plotted simultaneously: Y1 vs. X (in blue) and Y2 vs. X (in red). The actual 
				data points are displayed as small circles, and each data point is connected to 
				the next by a line segment (exception: in a subordinate sweep measurement, no 
				line segment is drawn between data points which correspond to di erent values 
				of the VAR2 variable). Each axis has controls which allow you to choose which 
				of the downloaded variables should be plotted on this axis, whether the axis 
				should be displayed in Linear or Logarithmic scale, and the minimum and maximum 
				values to show for this axis on the graph canvas. Most settings take e ect as 
				soon as you enter them; for numeric values, press the Enter key when you are 
				done typing. Note: when you run a measurement, the applet will automatically 
				select variables to graph for you. If you check the autoscale box, the minimum 
				and maximum values will be automatically determined for you based on the data 
				(note: in order to change these values manually again, you must uncheck the 
				autoscale box).<br>
				<br>
				The<strong> Tracking </strong>button at the bottle left corner of the Results 
				Panel causes a new window to be displayed when it is clicked. As you move the

			<p><br>
				The Weblab 6.1 Client does not yet have a built-in print feature. In order to 
				print the results, you must capture a screen dump and then use another program 
				to actually print the resulting image.<br>
				<strong>If you are using Windows:</strong><br>
				1. Select the window you want to print.<br>
				2. Press &lt;Alt&gt; + &lt;PrintScreen&gt; to copy an image of the currently 
				selected window to the clipboard. (note: on most Windows keyboards, the 
				PrintScreen key is located next to the Scroll Lock key, to the right of the 
				function keys F1 through F12)<br>
				3. Open up your favorite image editor (or word processor) and paste the 
				contents of the clipboard into a new document.<br>
				4. Print the image from your image editor or word processor.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>If you are using Athena:</strong><br>
				1. Run the xv program (type &ldquo;add graphics&rdquo;, then &ldquo;xv 
				&amp;&rdquo;).<br>
				2. When the xv window comes up, right-click on it to get your menu choices.<br>
				3. Click the &ldquo;grab&rdquo; button, and then use the right mouse button to 
				grab the window that you want to print.<br>
				4. Print the image from xv (note: you may need to scale it down in size in 
				order to fit the whole image on one sheet of paper).</p>

					Description of Parameter Analyser </a>
			</h1>
			<p>An Agilent 4155B semiconductor parameter analyzer is a state-of-the-art, 
				industrial-strength instrument of broad use in the microelectronics world. It 
				sends test currents and voltages through its connections to the DUT and 
				measures the response of the connected device.</p>
			<p>The Agilent 4155B semiconductor parameter analyzer has eight bi-directional 
				channels: four SMUs (Semiconductor Measuring Units), two VMUs (Voltage 
				Measuring Units), and two VSUs (Voltage Source Units). The SMUs are the most 
				versatile and commonly used channels. Each SMU can serve as a constant or 
				variable current source or voltage source. When serving as a current source, 
				the SMU monitors the voltage of the channel. When serving as a voltage source, 
				it monitors the current running through the channel. VMUs are high-quality 
				voltage monitors, and VSU channels are dedicated voltage sources.</p>
			<p>Figure 1 displays the multiple-device architecture. In this system, the 
				switching matrix routes signals between the Agilent 4155B parameter analyzer 
				and the eight DUTs. Like the parameter analyzer, the switching matrix can be 
				controlled remotely through its GPIB connection to the WebLab server. In this 
				system, the user can remotely select one of the eight connected DUTs as the 
				device to be measured.

			<p><strong>Figure B.1 - The architecture of the multiple-device WebLab system (versions 
					4.0-4.2). </strong><strong>Note that there are only 6 connections between each 
					DUT and the switching matrix because the switching matrix only offers 48 ports. </strong>
			<p>Before each transmission, the applet checks the test vector for common errors 
				that would render it not executable by the Agilent 4155B and refuses to submit 
				it until all such errors have been corrected by the user. When the test vector 
				passes all the rules in the applet's error checking procedure, the applet 
				submits it to the WebLab server using a HTTP connection. On the WebLab server, 
				one of a set of Active Server Pages (ASP) receives the uploaded vector through 
				Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). IIS includes a request queue 
				which the WebLab architecture fully utilizes. If another user is executing a 
				measurement when the request is received, the request is queued on IIS until 
				the instruments become available.</p>
			<p>When the request gets off the queue, the ASP wraps the data into method calls to 
				the third software component, the WebLab driver. This Visual-Basic-based driver 
				places the user's request into method calls to the fourth software component, a 
				commercially produced driver called VISA. The VISA driver then translates the 
				Visual Basic commands into GPIB commands. GPIB is the instrument control 
				language used by the Agilent 4155B. Through a commercially-available GPIB 
				interface card, the WebLab server transmits the GPIB method calls to the 
				parameter analyzer. The user's measurement request is thus relayed to the lab 
				equipment through this chain. In the background of this information flow, a 
				fifth component, a SQL database, records and supplies user information and 
				transaction data by communicating with the ASP.</p>
			<p>The user's selection request reaches the switching matrix in the form of GPIB 
				commands. The switching matrix then connects the parameter analyzer with the 
				selected device. When the parameter analyzer performs measurements, the 
				switching matrix ensures that all input/output signals run between the 
				parameter analyzer and the selected device. This multi-device WebLab system 
				offers much more flexibility and reliability than the single-device system.
			</p>
			<p>Upon receiving the request, the parameter analyzer performs the specified 
				measurements and responds to the GPIB interface card with the results. Through 
				the same path on which the request traveled to the lab equipment, the measured 
				data travel back to the client applet, which then graphs them for the user. 
				Since HTTP connections only persist through one request-response cycle, the 
				connection is closed by the server as soon as it returns the measurement data.</p>
			<p>A thermometer was added to the system architecture. This enables the WebLab user 
				to obtain the ambient temperature surrounding the DUTs. This is a useful 
				addition with significant educational impact because the behavior of 
				microelectronics devices is often influenced in a large way by their 
				surrounding temperature.</p>
