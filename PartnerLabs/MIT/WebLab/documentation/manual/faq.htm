			<p><em><strong>I'm having trouble with Weblab. What should I do? </strong></em>First, 
				read the User Manual and the rest of this document to see if your question has 
				already been addressed. If it is not, submit a bug report by clicking on the 
				"Report a Bug" link under the Service Broker's "Help" section.</p>
			<p><em><strong>Can I run the Weblab client on my computer running MAC OS X? </strong></em>
				Please see our <a href="/docs/weblab/v6.1/manual/system_req.htm">System 
					Requirements</a> page for a list of tested and supported OS/browser 
				configurations. <em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em> There appears to be a problem 
				with the current version of the iLab Service Broker that prevents the 
				successful launch of the WebLab client on Mac platforms. We are looking into 
				ways to solve this problem. In the meantime, please a tested platform listed in 
				our System Requirements page.<!--Mac OS X is not on this list only because we have not been able 
				to sufficiently test our software on this platform. However, we have observed 
				the following:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Graphical client works only with the Safari browser. The reason for this is 
						that Safari is the only browser we are aware of that includes a recent enough 
						Java runtime to execute the Weblab Graphical Applet code. Other browsers 
						(Netscape, Mozilla, etc.) will not work as they package Java 1.1 and Sun does 
						not produce a downloadable JRE package for the Mac platform.</li>
					<li>
						The Classical Applet should work on most browsers on the Mac platform as it 
						only requires Java 1.1 to run.</li>
				</ul>
				Problems using these platforms should be reported, as it helps us figure out 
				what works and what doesn't.--></p>
			<p class="style2"><em><strong>I've clicked on the "Launch Client" Button and, after a 
						reasonable amount of time, nothing has happened. What does this mean? </strong>
				</em>
			The WebLab 6.1 graphical client requires that your web browser be configured 
			with version 1.4.2 or greater of the Sun Java Plugin. If your browser is not 
			properly configured, the applet will fail to launch when requested. If you 
			encounter this problem, make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest 
			version of the Java Plugin. Instructions for checking your browser's plugin 
			configuration and downloading the Java Plugin can be found below.
			<p class="style2"><em><strong>I can log on and access the lab client. When I click "Launch 
						Lab," the applet loads but I get the following error: "Server error: An I/O 
						error occurred. Failed to load lab configuration. Try again?"</strong></em>
				This error can be caused by a number of different things. Some causes are:<BR>
				<ol class="style2">
					<li>
						If you browse to the Service Broker using a URL other than that given to you. 
						For example, if the Service Broker URL is http://ilab.mit.edu/, but you access 
						the broker via http://ilab/ or by browsing to the IP address. In this case, the 
						client will fail to initialize.</li>
					<li>
						If you log into the Service Broker and leave the session idle for approximately 
						30 minutes and then try to launch the client, the client will fail to 
						initialize.</li>
					<li>
						If, at the security warning dialog that is presented while the client is 
						loading, you click on the "No" button, the client will fail to initialize. This 
						warning indicates that the client is requesting privileges above and beyond 
						what is typical for a Java applet. These privileges are what enable the client 
						to communicate with the Service Broker as well as save experiment results to 
						your computer.</li>
				</ol>
				If none of these resolve the problem, please submit a bug report using the 
				Service Broker's "Report a Bug" feature (located in the "Help" section). Be 
				sure to include the following information:
				<BR>
				<ul class="style2">
					<li>
					browser type &amp; version, OS type and version./li>
					<li>
						a description of the steps you take to encounter the error. This should span 
						from launching your web browser to the error itself. Please be as descript as 
						possible.</li>
					<li>
						once the error has occurred, copy the entire contents of the Java Console and 
						include it in your reply.</li>
				</ul>
			<p class="style2"><em><strong>How can I tell which version of the Java Plugin I have? </strong>
				</em>
			Open the Java Console and scroll to the top of the window. The very first line 
			should say something like "Using JRE version 1.5.0_04 Java HotSpot(TM) Client 
			VM". If you see a version number that's less than 1.4.2, you need to install a 
			new Java Plugin if you want to use the WebLab 6.1 client. .
			<p class="style2"><em><strong>How do I open the Java Console? </strong></em>
				<br>
				<strong>If you are using a Windows or Linux:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In Internet Explorer, go to Tools -&gt; Sun Java Console.</li>
					<li>
						In Netscape, go to Tasks -&gt; Tools -&gt; Java Console.</li>
					<li>
						In Mozilla, go to Tools -&gt; Web Development -&gt; Java Console.</li>
				</ul>
			<p class="style2">
				<strong>If you are using Mac OSX</strong>
			- Unfortunately, Mac OS X browsers do not give you a convenient menu item for 
			displaying the Java console when you want to. In order to display the console, 
			please perform the following configuration:<p>
			Open a Finder window. Select Applications (from the quick-access bar on the 
			left), then browse to Utilities/Java/<p>
			You'll see two items called "Java 1.3.1 Plugin Settings" (if you are using 
			Firefox) and/or "Java 1.4.2 Plugin Settings" (if you are using Safari) which 
			control the settings of the respective plugins. Open each of them in turn, 
			check the box for "Show Java Console" or "Use Java console", and close the 
			settings box again. From now on, the Java console should automatically appear 
			on the screen whenever you load an applet in your browser (note: you may need 
			to quit your browser and restart it first).
			<p class="style2">
			If you can't find a "Java Console" menu option, you probably need to install a 
			new Java Plugin.
			<p class="style2"><em><strong>Where can I download the Java Plugin? </strong></em>Go 
				to <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp</a>
			(note: the link you want is &quot;Download JRE 5.0 Update 4&quot; under the in 
			the "JRE 5.0 Update 4" section, about half way down the page)
			<p class="style2"><em><strong>Okay, I've read the documentation carefully, and I'm still 
						having trouble. Now what? </strong></em>Submit a detailed bug report to 
				the developers, and we'll get back to you as quickly as possible. To submit a 
				bug report, click on the "Report a Bug" link under the Service Broker's "Help" 
				section. Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="ilab-debug@mit.edu">ilab-debug@mit.edu</a>
			. However, using the "Report a Bug" feature will help us diagnose your problem 
			faster.
			<p class="style2"><em><strong>What information should I include in my bug report? </strong>
				</em>
			We try to monitor Weblab regularly and to address problems as they arise, so it 
			is usually the case that everything is working pretty well as far as we know. 
			Submitting a bug report that says nothing more than "X doesn't work" is 
			therefore not likely to be particularly helpful, because in all probability 
			we've tested X ourselves in the past and it has worked just fine for us. In 
			order to help us figure out why it isn't working just fine for you, we need to 
			know as much as possible about the problem.
			<p class="style2">A good bug report should include at least the following pieces of 
				information:
				<ul class="style2">
					<li>
					a concise one-sentence summary of the bug, e.g. "SMU port icon shows the wrong 
					image"
					<li>
					your system configuration (browser, operating system, and Java plugin), e.g. 
					"I'm running Netscape 6.2.3 on Windows XP Professional, with Java Plugin 
					version 1.4.2_03"
					<li>
						a precise step-by-step explanation of how to duplicate the bug, e.g.
						<ol>
					<li>
					launch the Graphical Applet
					<li>
					select Device 1 from the Devices menu
					<li>
					click on SMU1
					<li>
					set Mode to I, Function to CONS, and Value to 1.0 mA, and click OK
					<li>
						observe that the port image for SMU1 in the schematic diagram has been replaced 
						by a picture of a giant weasel
					</li>
					</ol>
					<li>
						the complete output from your Java console
					</li>
				</ul>
			<p class="style2">If you encounter an error message, be sure to include the exact 
				text of the error message in your bug report.</p>
			<p class="style2"><em><strong>My experiment runs, and I think I have everything set up 
						right, but the data looks not at all like what I expect.</strong></em> Check 
				the compliance values carefully to make sure you haven&rsquo;t set them too 
				low. If a compliance value is exceeded during the measurement, this can have a 
				major impact on the rest of the data points, and there is unfortunately no 
				obvious way to tell when a compliance has been exceeded.</p>
