		<p class="style3">The MIT Microelectronics WebLab is a remote microelectronics 
			device characterization laboratory. It allows users to measure the 
			current-voltage characteristics of diodes and other microelectronics devices 
			remotely, using a Java-enabled web browser.&nbsp; To run the Microelectronics 
			WebLab, you must have a Java 1.4.2 plug-in installed, available from <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">
				Sun's web site</a>. You must also enable pop-ups.</p>
		<h1><a name="simple" class="style8">Basic Diode Experiment</a></h1>
		<p class="style3">First, you will need to create an account at <a href="http://ilab.mit.edu/">
				the WebLab web site</a>. Account group permissions are manually approved; 
			as a result, there may be up to a 24 hour delay between when you create the 
			account, and when you can run the WebLab experiments. Once your account has 
			been enabled, log in, and select the group appropriate for your class. Select 
			the <b>graphical client</b>, and from there, select <b>Launch Client</b>. You 
			may be asked whether you authorize the downloading of the WebLab client 
			software to your computer; approve this. After a short download and startup 
			time, the client should appear in a new window:
		</p>

			<p class="style3">Figure 1: The WebLab 6.1 Client
			</p>
		</center>
		<p class="style3">We will now walk you through the simplest WebLab experiment -- 
			testing the properties of a PN diode. When the client is launched, it 
			automatically makes the diode experiment available to you. The diode symbol has 
			a triangle pointing into a vertical line. The diode is connected to an 
			instrument that is going to perform the actual measurements -- an Agilent 4155B 
			Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. The boxes labeled SMU1 and SMU2 correspond to 
			the signal measurement ports of this 4155B. Characterizing the electrical 
			behavior of the PN diode requires that these two SMU's be programmed 
			appropriately.
		</p>
		<p class="style3">Click on the box labeled SMU1. This will open a dialog box that 
			allows you to configure SMU1. Since this is the anode, label the voltage Va and 
			the current Ia. Check the <b>download</b> checkbox for both (WebLab will only 
			allow you to plot the voltages and currents that you download). Set SMU1 to 
			voltage mode, with the function set as Variable 1. Configure the voltage to 
			sweep the voltage from -1.5V through 1.5V in 10mV increments. Do not adjust the 
			compliance setting -- this sets the maximum current that the 4155B will allow 
			on any terminals, so as not to damage the device (this setting will be 
			correctly preconfigured, and will depend on the type of diode currently in the 
			system):

			<p class="style3">Figure 2: SMU1 Configuration
			</p>
		</center>
		<p>You will now want to configure SMU2. Instead of sweeping the voltage, you will 
			want SMU2 connected to ground. As a result, set it to common mode. Since this 
			is the cathode, label the voltage Vc and the current Ic. You do not need to 
			download the voltage, since it is fixed. Also, the diode is a two-terminal 
			device, so Ia=Ic. Therefore, there is no reason to download both Ia and Ic 
			(downloading more variables will increase execution time of the experiment):

			<p class="style3">Figure 3: SMU2 Configuration
			</p>
		</center>
		<p>From the <b>Measurement</b> menu, select <b>Run Measurement</b>. Depending on 
			the number of users, you may need to wait a short amount of time for the 
			experiment to run. Once the experiment is run, you should see a plot of the IV 
			characteristic of the diode:

			<p class="style3">Figure 4: Diode Characterization Results</p>
		</center>
		<p>In order to prevent damage to the diode, we have limited the maximum current 
			(see the section on the compliance setting above). As a result, depending on 
			the diode currently in the test setup, you may see the results saturate.
		</p>
		<p>You can modify the axes from the dropdowns to the sides of the plot. Try 
			switching the Y axis into logarithmic mode for a better idea of how the diode 
			behaves.
		</p>
		<p class="style3">After an experiment is run it is possible to download the 
			experimental data to your machine. From the <b>Results</b> menu, you have the 
			option of viewing the data in a pop-up window, or downloading it into a comma 
			separated values (CSV) file suitable for Matlab, spreadsheets, or other 
			applications.
		</p>
		<p>Congratulations! You have successfully completed your first WebLab measurement.

		<h1 class="style3"><a name="complex" class="style8">Transistor Experiment </a>
		</h1>
		<p class="style3">This tutorial walks you through a slightly more complicated 
			experiment -- analyzing a transistor.
		</p>
		<p class="style3">First, if you have not already done so, you will need to create 
			an account at <a href="http://ilab.mit.edu/">the WebLab web site</a>. Account 
			group permissions are manually approved, and as a result, there may be up to a 
			24 hour delay between when you create the account, and when you can run the 
			WebLab experiments. Once your account has been enabled, log in, and select the 
			group appropriate for your class. Select the graphical client, and from there, 
			select <b>Launch Client</b>. You may be asked whether you authorize the 
			downloading of the WebLab client software to your computer; approve this. After 
			a short download and startup time, the client should appear in a new window:
		</p>
		<center>
			<p><img src="images/pn_diode_setup_u.jpg" height="701" width="599"></p>
			<p class="style3">Figure 1: The WebLab 6.1 Client
			</p>
		</center>
		<p class="style3">Once loaded the client will be set to the default device, the 
			diode. From the <b>Devices</b> menu, select 2n7000 MOSFET transistor:

			<p class="style3">Figure 2: WebLab with Transistor Selected
			</p>
		</center>
		Now, we will configure the ports connected to the transistor. Click on SMU1, 
		connected to the drain of the transistor. Name the voltage Vd, and the current 
		Id. Download both, so that you can later plot them. Now, configure this port in 
		voltage mode and as variable one, sweeping the voltage from 0V through 4V in 
		200mV increments:

			<p class="style3">Figure 3: SMU1 Configuration
			</p>
		</center>
		<p class="style3">Configure the gate terminal, SMU2, to use names Vg and Ig, 
			voltage mode, function VAR2, a data range of 0.0V to 3.0V, and step size of 
			200mV. The compliance (maximum gate current) should be limited to 1.0 mA. 
			Download the gate voltage. Unless you are particularly interested in gate 
			leakage, there is no reason to download gate current:

			<p class="style3">Figure 4: SMU2 Configuration
			</p>
		</center>
		<p class="style3">The source terminal should be held at ground. You do this by 
			configuring SMU3 using names Vs and Is, and setting the mode to COMM:

			<p class="style3">Figure 5: SMU3 Configuration
			</p>
		</center>
		<p class="style3">The experiment is ready to be submitted to the lab server. First, 
			in case something goes wrong, you should save the current setup. From the <b>setup</b>
			menu, select <b>Save setup</b>. Setups are permanently saved to your account 
			and may be loaded, edited, deleted or submitted whenever you login to the lab 
			sever using this account.
		</p>
		<p class="style3">Submit your experiment by selecting <b>Run Measurement</b> from 
			the <b>Measurement</b> menu. Once the experiment is submitted to the lab 
			server, the system will verify whether the experiment is properly configured. 
			If not, it will display an error message telling you what the problem is. If 
			the experiment passes the validation checks, it is placed on a queue. The 
			"please wait" message is displayed. Depending on the number of experiments in 
			the queue, the wait time for your experiment may vary. Once the experiment is 
			complete, the results are downloaded to the client, and assuming the axes are 
			reasonably configured, shown in the client window:

			<p class="style3">Figure 6: Output Result Plots
			</p>
		</center>
		<p class="style3">If your window does not show a similar plot, set the <b>X1</b> axis 
			to display <b>Vd</b>, the <b>Y1</b> axis to display <b>Id</b>, <b>Y2</b> axis 
			to <b>none</b>, and all axes to Linear/autoscale. From here, try changing the 
			variables and scales, and see how the plots change.
		</p>
		<p class="style3">The Weblab client also allows you do define custom functions. In 
			the next part of this tutorial, we will show how this can be used to plot 
			small-signal conductance of the transistor. Select <b>Show User-Defined Functions</b>
			from the <b>User Defined Functions</b> menu. The <b>User-Defined Functions</b> window 
			should open. Click the <b>Add new function</b> button in this window. Entering 
			the the following information to create a named variable GD which is the 
			derivative of drain current divided by drain voltage:

		<p class="style3">Resubmit your experiment to the server. Plot <b>Id</b> on the <b>Y1</b>
			axis, and <b>GD</b> on the <b>Y2</b> axis.

		</center>
		<p class="style3">After an experiment is run it is possible to download the 
			experiment data to your machine. From the <b>Results</b> menu item you have the 
			option of viewing the data in a pop-up window, or downloading it into a comma 
			separated values (CSV) file suitable for import into Matlab, a spreadsheet, or 
			many other applications.
