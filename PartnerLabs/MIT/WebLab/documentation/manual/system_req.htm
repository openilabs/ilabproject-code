			The following system configurations are offcially supported by the Weblab 
			development team (we are confident that they work, and we will do our best to 
			help you get them to work if you are having trouble):</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="style2">&bull; Windows 2000, XP<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Netscape 4.7 (or newer) with Java Plugin 1.4.2 
				or greater
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Internet Explorer 6.0 (or newer), with Java 
				Plugin 1.4.2 or greater
				<br>
				&bull; MIT Athena Computing Environment (Sun and Linux based machines only)<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Mozilla, with default Athena settings</p>

			Note: although we believe this applet to be compatible with any Java-enabled 
			browser, we have not yet had a chance to perform exhaustive testing. Also, some 
			older browsers may have compatibility problems with the service broker website 
			itself. So far we have verified that the client definitely works with the 
			following browser configurations (feel free to try it with other configurations 
			and let us know how it works):
			<ul>
				<li>
					Windows 2000, XP: Java Plugin 1.4.2 or greater with Mozilla Firefox 1.0 or 
					Internet Explorer 6.0
				</li>
				<li>
					Solaris: Java Plugin 1.4.2 or greater with Mozilla 1.7.5
				</li>
				<li>
					Linux: Java Plugin 1.4.2 or greater with Mozilla 1.7.5 (caveat: on many linux 
					installations the fonts appear very large, which may make the applet harder to 
					use)</li>
			</ul>
