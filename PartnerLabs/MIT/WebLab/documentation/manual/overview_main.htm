				<h1><strong><a name="goals" class="style8">Introduction</a></strong></h1>
				<p class="style2">The M.I.T. Microelectronics WebLab or "WebLab" is a remote 
					microelectronics device characterization laboratory. It enables users to 
					measure the current-voltage characteristics various microelectronics devices at 
					any time, from any physical location, using a Java-enabled web browser.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p class="style2">WebLab is one of the laboratories available under the iLabs 
					project which is dedicated to the proposition that online laboratories - real 
					laboratories accessed through the Internet - can enrich science and engineering 
					education by greatly expanding the range of experiments that students are 
					exposed to in the course of their education. Unlike conventional laboratories, 
					iLabs can be shared across a university or across the world. The iLabs vision 
					is to share expensive equipment and educational materials associated with lab 
					experiments as broadly as possible within higher education and beyond.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">The major goal of the WebLab project is to deliver the 
					educational benefits of hands-on experimentation to students anywhere, at any 
					time. This project provides the technology to make microelectronics test 
					equipment available over the Internet. Students are able to enjoy the complete 
					laboratory experience which can be delivered to any conventional Java-enabled 
					web browser. Today, web browsers are ubiquitous; therefore, through WebLab, 
					students can take current-voltage measurements on transistors and other devices 
					in real time from anywhere and at anytime. In addition, expensive equipment and 
					educational materials associated with lab experiments are shared as broadly as 
					possible within higher education and beyond.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">Some of the devices available for I-V characterization include pn 
					diodes, nmos/pmos field effect transistors, and npn/pnp bipolar junction 
					transistors. The user is able to change the operating conditions of the 
					experiment such as bias voltages and currents, compliance values, voltage and 
					current sweep ranges, etc using a simple graphical interface. The results of 
					the experiments are immediately displayed as graphs in the Weblab applet 
					console, and can be downloaded as a comma separated file for post processing 
					using matlab or any spread sheet application.
				</p>
				<p class="style1"><a href="#top" class="style6"></a></p>
				<h1><strong><a name="arch" class="style8">Architecture</a></strong></h1>
				<p class="style2">The Microelectronics WebLab is based on the iLabs Shared 
					Architecture. iLabs' design separates online labs into three distinct modules 
					connected by a Web service architecture.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; The Lab Server is operated by the lab's owner and 
					deals with the actual operation of the lab hardware. While the semiconductor 
					test equipment performs the testing, the Lab Server component is what enables 
					this testing to be initiated remotely. The Lab Server itself is a PC running 
					Windows 2000 that houses all of the software components of the system. In 
					addition, this machine is configured with an Agilent 82350A PC/GPIB Interface 
					card. This allows the Lab Server to control and receive data from all hardware 
					components that are connected to the GPIB network.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; The Lab Client runs on the end user's computer, and 
					provides the interface to the operation of the lab. Specifically, is a Java 
					applet which serves as the client's interface to the instrumentation hardware. 
					It provides the user with an interface similar to that of the front panel of 
					the 4155B while also incorporating the multiple device access and temperature 
					measurement ability of the E5250A and the 34970A respectively. This is where 
					the end-user decides what device to test, what signals to send to the device as 
					input and what ports to listen for data on.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; The Service Broker mediates exchanges between the 
					Lab Client and the Lab Server and provides storage and administrative services 
					that are generic and can be shared by multiple labs within a single university.
				</p>
				<p><img width="500" height="333" src="images/image1.gif"></p>
				<p class="style2">Figure 1: Overview of iLabs Shared Architecture</p>
				<p class="style2">The Semiconductor Test Component of the WebLab System provides 
					the core functionality of the system. Testing and characterization of 
					microelectronic devices is performed by the handful of devices. First, an 
					Agilent 4155B Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer is used to carry out the actual 
					measurements. This device is what provides the test signals and 
					receives/processes returned signals from a given microelectronic device under 
					test. Specifically, the device under test is placed in an Agilent 16442A Test 
					Fixture, which is connected to the signal outputs of the 4155B. The 4155B is 
					directly controlled by the Web Server through the system's GPIB network. This 
					enables the Web Server to configure the 4155B and initiate the test process.</p>
				<p class="style2">In order to make eight microelectronic devices available for test 
					to the WebLab System, a multiplexing device must be integrated into this 
					component. The system makes use of the Agilent E5250A Low Leakage Switch 
					Mainframe to perform this function. The E5250A is ideal for this application, 
					primarily, because it is an exceptionally low-loss switch. As such, there is 
					little signal degradation across the switch. Additionally, the E5250A can be 
					controlled via GBIP. Thus, the signal output of the 4155B is connected to the 
					input of the E5250A, which routes it to one of eight sets of output ports. Each 
					of these output ports connects one of the above mentioned 16442A Test Fixtures. 
					As was the case with the 4155B, the E5250A is connected to the system's GPIB 
					network. This allows the Web Server to control which of the eight test devices 
					the 4155B's signals are routed to.

					<strong><a name="experiment" class="style8">Typical Experiment </a></strong>
				</h1>
				<p class="style2">A relatively simple experiment which can be run using the M.I.T. 
					Microelectronics WebLab is obtaining the output characteristics of a pn diode. 
					The diagram in Figure 3 shows the layout of the experimental set up. The diode 
					symbol has a triangle pointing into a vertical line. In a diode, current can 
					flow in the direction indicated by this pointy triangle, but not in the other 
					direction; stated simply, a diode is a one way electronic valve. In the diagram 
					of Figure 1, the diode is connected to an instrument that is going to perform 
					the actual measurements. In WebLab, this is an Agilent 4155B Semiconductor 
					Parameter Analyzer. The boxes labeled SMU1 and SMU2 represent the signal 
					measurement units of this instrument to which the diode is connected. 
					Characterizing the electrical behavior of the pn diode requires that these two 
					SMU's be programmed appropriately.
				</p>
				<p><img width="558" height="719" src="images/pn_diode_setup.jpg"></p>
				<p class="style2">Figure 3: The WebLab 6.1 Client
				</p>
				<p class="style2">This experimental setup grounds SMU2 and successively applies a 
					voltage to SMU1 from -1.5 to +1.5 volts in 10 milliVolt increments, and will 
					measure the current flowing through SMU 1 .&nbsp; The voltages and currents on 
					each of the leads of the pn diode are controlled by SMU1 and SMU2. Clicking 
					your mouse on the SMU's would bring up dialog boxes which are used to configure 
					the voltages or currents on each of these leads. The Webab user's manual 
					explains to you how to program the SMU's . The tutorial examples on this web 
					site illustrates how to do this.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">Once the configuration of the experiment is completed, you can 
					click on the &quot;Measurement&quot; item on the menu bar. Do this and select 
					the &quot;Run Measurement&quot; option (the only option available on this menu 
					item). This will submit the experiment over the Internet to the WebLab server 
					for execution. You can also click on the &quot;Running Man&quot; icon in the 
					upper right of the WebLab client program to submit an experiment. Once the 
					experiment is complete the results are downloaded to the client. The resulting 
					window should look like Figure 4 below.
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp; <img width="558" height="719" src="images/pn_diode_results.jpg"></p>
				<p class="style2">Figure 4: Plot of Output from Diode Experiment
				</p>
				<p class="style2">The graph shows the voltage across the diode on the <em>x </em>axis 
					and the current through the diode on the <em>y </em>axis. For this simple 
					experiment, the graph is the diode characteristic that is familiar to 
					electrical engineers. Namely, the current remains negligible until the voltage 
					reaches about 0.6 Volts, at which point the current increases rapidly in an 
					exponential way. In our experiment, we limit the current to 100 milliAmps. This 
					limit is imposed by the experimental setup.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">This characteristic behavior allows the pn diode to act as a 
					valve for current; if the voltage between the leads is less than about 0.6 
					Volts (the voltage needed in the diode to allow it to conduct current), no 
					current flows; if it it a bit higher than 0.6 Volts, the current rises quickly 
					to the maximum allowed value.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">You can change the way the experimental data is plotted by 
					altering the scale of the axes. For example, try resetting the scale on the <em>y </em>
					axis from linear to logarithmic. The data should be redisplayed with the new 
					axes.

				<h1>
					<strong><a name="policy" class="style8">Policies and constraints </a></strong>
				</h1>
				<p class="style2">In order to provide a seamless experience, the WebLab team 
					introduced a number of policies and constraints:
				</p>
				<p class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; Number of data points in the results generated is 
					limited to a particular value. The Weblab applet checks for this constraint at 
					run time and informs the user if this value is exceeded.
				</p>
				<p class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; There is a maximum voltage or current that can be 
					applied to the leads of a device. This is called the default compliance value 
					is automatically set to protect the measuring equipment and devices from 
					damage. Thus, whenever the voltage or current in an experiment exceeds the 
					compliance value, the results obtained saturates to that value.
				</p>
				<p><span class="style2">&#149;&nbsp; Only one applet instance can be opened per internet browser.</span></p>
