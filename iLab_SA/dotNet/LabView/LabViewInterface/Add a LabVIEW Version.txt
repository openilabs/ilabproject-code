To support a new version of LabVIEW:

Note: It does not seem possible for one lab server to support more 
than one release of LabVIEW.

Use TLBIMP to create a DLL from the labview.tlb file located in the 
...\National Instruments\LabVIEW version\resource directory.

tlbimp labview.tlb /out:Interop.LabVIEW_verrsion /namespace:LabVIEW.lvVersion

Copy an existing LabViewInterface project file and rename to the target version 
remove the reference to the old Interop dll & replace with the target version.
Change the properties build option defined value to match the target version.

open the project, in the properties directory make a copy of the AssemblyInfoxxx.cs file. 
Using the project properties folder rename the original AssemblyInfoxxx.cs file to 
reflect the new version file. In the directory rename the copy to the original file name.
Edit the new AssemblyInfo file to reflect the new assembly and a new GUID.

Add #ifDef statements to the Following files LabViewInterface.cs, LabViewRemote.cs 
and LabViewTask.cs to support the build option and new namespace.

Add an else if clause to LabViewTaskFactory so the correct version task is created.

Use the web publishing tool to wrap any VI, save the HTML file. Create a new switch case condition 
in LVRemotePanel.ascx.cs with the values from the generated html file. 

Set the Web.config file to use the version tag that you created.
